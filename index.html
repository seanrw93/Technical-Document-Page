        Present Simple vs Present Progressive
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>We use<strong> the present simple</strong> and <strong>the present progressive</strong> to talk about things that take place in the present.</p>
        <p>The simple present is used for permanent actions, to describe daily events, facts or as a narrative form for stories that take place in the present.</p> 
        <p>The present progressive is used for temporary actions and to describe what is happening at the moment of speaking.</p>
        <p>Compare these two statements:</p>
        <code><strong>Present Simple</strong>
        <i>I play tennis.</i>
          <br>
        <strong>Present Progressive</strong> 
        <i>I am playing tennis.</i>
        </code>
        <p><strong>Present Simple:</strong> ‘I play tennis’ tells us that playing tennis is something the speaker always does. It is part of a routine or habit. We can call this a permanent situation.</p>
        <p><strong>Present Progressive:</strong> ‘I am playing tennis’ tells us that the speaker is playing tennis right now. Soon the game will be over. We call this a temporary situation.<p>
        <h4>Frequency Adverbs we use with the Present Simple
</h4>
       <p>With the present simple we use these frequency adverbs:</p>
<p>(Notice that the adverb comes before the main verb in the sentence.)</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Always:</strong> ‘I always read before I go to bed.’</li>
          <li><strong>Often:</strong> ‘Her sister often comes shopping with us.’</li>
          <li><strong>Sometimes: </strong>‘You sometimes go to the gym, don’t you?’</li>
          <li><strong>Occasionally:</strong> ‘It occasionally rains in summer.’</li>
          <li><strong>Rarely:</strong> ‘He rarely goes out without his backpack.’</li>
          <li><strong>Never:</strong> ‘Japanese people never wear shoes inside.’</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Time Expressions we use with the Present Continuous</h4>
        <p>With the present continuous we use these time expressions:</p>
        <p>(Notice that the time expression can come at the start or at the end of the sentence.)</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>At the moment:</strong> ‘I’m watching TV, at the moment.’</li>
          <li><strong>These days:</strong> ‘Paul’s living in Cardiff, these days.’</li>
          <li><strong>Now:</strong> ‘What are you doing, now?’</li>
          <li><strong>Nowadays:</strong> ‘I think you are smoking too much, nowadays.’</li>

      <header>Past Simple vs Past Progressive</header>
      <article>
          <p>The <strong>past simple</strong> and the <strong>past progressive</strong> are used to express actions in the past. We use the simple past as the narrative form of the past to express completed, sequential actions. <strong>Regular</strong> past simple verbs have -ed at the end (e.g. called, played, arrived). <strong>Irregular</strong> verbs have a different form, usually with a different vowel sound (e.g. wake → woke, break → broke, feel → felt).
        </p>
        <p>Have a look at this list of <a href="https://www.e-grammar.org/download/list-of-irregular-verbs.pdf">irregular verbs!</a></p>
          <p>We use the past progressive to say what was happening at a particular moment in the past, to set the scene and to emphasise duration of a past action.</p>
          <code>
            <strong>Past Simple</strong>
            <i> I spoke to John Yesterday.</i>
            <br>
            <strong>Past Progressive</strong> 
            <i> I was speaking to John when my phone rang.</i>
          </code>
          <p><strong>Past Simple:</strong> ‘I spoke to John yesterday’ tells us that both the time and action are permanently finished.</p>
          <p>We make the negative with didn't and the infinitive verb.<p>
          <ul>
            <li>My parents didn't call me yesterday.</li>
            <li>I didn't wake up early this morning.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We make the question form with did and then the subject and infinitive verb.</p>
          <ul>
           <li>Did you wake up early this morning?</li>
           <li>Did Sam play basketball when he was at university?</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Past Progressive:</strong> ‘I was speaking to John when my phone rang ’ show an action going on at a certain time in the past. Here we see an interrupted action.</p>
          <p>The past progressive can also shows us that the action was already in progress at a certain time in the past.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What were you doing at 8 p.m. last night? I was studying.</li>
            <li>This means that I started studying before 8 p.m. and I continued after 8 p.m.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The past continuous can also show that an activity was in progress for some time, not just for a moment.<p>
          <ul>
            <li>We were cleaning the house all morning.</li>
          </ul>  
          <p>We make the past continuous with was or were and the -ing form of the verb.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>She couldn't come to the party. She was working.</li>
            <li>Three years ago, we were living in my home town.</li>
            <li>I tried to give him some advice, but he wasn't listening.</li>
            <li>What were you doing this time last year?</li>
          </ul>

      <header>Present Perfect Simple</header>
      <article>
        <p>The present perfect is a verb tense which is used to show that an action has taken place once or many times before now. The present perfect is most frequently used to talk about experiences or changes that have taken place, but there are other less common uses as well.</p>
        <p>The present perfect is formed using has/have + past participle. Questions are indicated by inverting the subject and has/have. Negatives are made with not.</p>
        <p>Again, be careful of those infamous <a href="https://www.e-grammar.org/download/list-of-irregular-verbs.pdf">irregular verbs!</a></p>
        <code>
          <strong>Statement:</strong>
          <i>You have seen that movie many times.</i><br>
          <strong>Question:</strong> 
          <i>Have you seen that movie many times?</i><br>
          <strong>Negative:</strong> 
          <i>You have not seen that movie many times.</i>
        </code>
        <h4>USE 1: Unspecified time before now</h4>
          <p>We use the present perfect to say that an action happened at an unspecified time before now. The exact time is not important. You CANNOT use the present perfect with specific time expressions such as yesterday, one year ago, last week, when I was a child, when I lived in Japan, at that moment, that day, one day, etc. We CAN use the present perfect with unspecific expressions such as ever, never, once, many times, several times, before, so far, already, yet, etc.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>I have seen that movie twenty times.</li>
            <li>I think I have met him once before.</li>
            <li>There have been many earthquakes in California.</li>
            <li>People have traveled to the Moon.</li>
            <li>People have not traveled to Mars.</li>
            <li>Have you read the book yet?</li>
          </ul>
        <h4>USE 2: Duration From the Past Until Now (Non-Continuous Verbs)</h4>
          <p>With non-continuous verbs and non-continuous uses of mixed verbs, we use the present perfect to show that something started in the past and has continued up until now. For five minutes, for two weeks, and since Tuesday are all durations which can be used with the present perfect (Note: for continuous verbs, the <a href="#Present_Perfect_Progressive">Present Perfect PROGRESSIVE.</a> is used).</p>
          <p>Examples:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>I have had a cold for two weeks.</li>
            <li>She has been in England for six months.</li>
            <li>Mary has loved chocolate since she was a little girl.</li>
          </ul>

      <article>
        <p>The <strong>present perfect continuous</strong> is a verb tense which is used to show that an action started in the past and has continued up to the present moment. The present perfect continuous usually emphasizes duration, or the amount of time that an action has been taking place.</p>
        <p>The present perfect continuous is formed using has/have + been + present participle. Questions are indicated by inverting the subject and has/have. Negatives are made with not.</p>
        <code>
          <strong>Statement: </strong>
          <i>You have been waiting here for two hours.</i>
          <br>
          <strong>Question: </strong>
          <i>Have you been waiting here for two hours?</i>
          <br>
          <strong>Negative: </strong>
          <i>You have not been waiting here for two hours.</i>
        </code>
        <h4>USE 1: Duration from the Past Until Now</h4>
        <p>We use the present perfect continuous to show that something started in the past and has continued up until now. For five minutes, for two weeks, and since Tuesday are all durations which can be used with the present perfect continuous.</p>
        <p>REMEMBER:</p>
        <code>
          <strong>FOR</strong> = <i>duration</i>
          <br>
          <strong>SINCE</strong> = <i>specific time in the past</i>
        </code>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>They have been talking for the last hour.</li>
          <li>She has been working at that company for three years.</li>
          <li>What have you been doing for the last 30 minutes?</li>
          <li>James has been teaching at the university since June.</li>
          <li>We have been waiting here for over two hours!</li>
          <li>Why has Nancy not been taking her medicine for the last three days?</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>USE 2: Recently, Lately</h4>
        <p>You can also use the present perfect continuous WITHOUT a duration such as for two weeks. Without the duration, the tense has a more general meaning of lately. We often use the words lately or recently to emphasize this meaning.</p>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Recently, I have been feeling really tired.</li>
          <li>She has been watching too much television lately.</li>
          <li>Have you been exercising lately?</li>
          <li>Mary has been feeling a little depressed.</li>
          <li>Lisa has not been practicing her English.</li>
          <li>What have you been doing?</li>
        </ul>
